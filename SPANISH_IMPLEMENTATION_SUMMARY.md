# Spanish Language Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the complete implementation of Spanish language support in the BMI App.

## Overview

The Spanish language implementation adds full support for Spanish (es) across all components of the BMI App, including:
- API endpoints
- Web interface
- Core business logic
- Data models and translations
- Test coverage

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core i18n System (`core/i18n.py`)

- Extended the `Language` type alias to include "es"
- Added comprehensive Spanish translation dictionary with all necessary keys
- Added new translation keys for previously missing items:
  - Risk assessment notes for elderly, children, and teens
  - Level descriptions (advanced, intermediate, novice, beginner)
- Verified validation function works across all three languages

### 2. Body Fat Module (`bodyfat.py`)

- Updated language handling to include Spanish support
- Added Spanish labels for body fat calculation results:
  - "métodos" for methods
  - "mediana" for median
  - "%" for units

### 3. BMI Core Module (`bmi_core.py`)

- Replaced hardcoded language strings with i18n system calls
- Updated all functions to properly support Spanish:
  - `bmi_category()` now uses i18n for all BMI categories
  - `interpret_group()` uses i18n for group notes
  - `group_display_name()` now supports Spanish group names
  - `estimate_level()` uses i18n for fitness levels
  - `build_premium_plan()` now has Spanish action and activity tips
- Updated `normalize_lang()` to accept Spanish as a valid language and handle locale-specific codes (es-ES, etc.)
- Enhanced `auto_group()` to recognize Spanish terms for gender and pregnancy

### 4. Web Interface (`app.py`)

- Enhanced the web interface with dynamic language support
- Added Spanish translations for all form labels and UI elements
- Implemented client-side language switching with cookie persistence
- Added language selector with ES/RU/EN options

### 5. API Endpoints

All API endpoints now accept the `lang` parameter with "es" as a valid value:
- `/bmi` endpoint
- `/api/v1/bodyfat` endpoint (uses `language` parameter)
- `/api/v1/bmi/pro` endpoint
- `/plan` endpoint

## Supported Spanish Terms

The application recognizes Spanish terms for various fields:
- **Gender**: "hombre" (male), "mujer" (female)
- **Pregnant**: "si" or "sí" (yes), "no" (no)
- **Athlete**: "atleta" (athlete), "si" (yes), "no" (no)

## Test Coverage

Comprehensive test coverage was implemented to ensure Spanish language support works correctly:

### Unit Tests
- `tests/test_i18n_parity.py`: Tests for i18n parity across all languages
- `tests/test_bmi_category_localized.py`: Tests for BMI categories across languages
- `tests/test_group_display_es.py`: Tests for group display names in Spanish
- `tests/test_level_es.py`: Tests for fitness levels in Spanish

### API Tests
- `tests/test_api_spanish.py`: API endpoint tests for Spanish language
- `tests/test_api_end_to_end_spanish.py`: End-to-end API tests for Spanish language
- `tests/test_bmi_pro_spanish.py`: BMI Pro specific tests for Spanish language

### Web Interface Tests
- `tests/test_web_interface_spanish.py`: Web interface tests for Spanish language
- `tests/test_spanish_end_to_end_smoke.py`: Complete end-to-end workflow tests

## Documentation

- Updated `README.md` with language information and examples
- Created `SPANISH_EXAMPLES.md` with detailed curl examples
- Added language selector to web interface

## Validation

All tests pass successfully:
- 31 Spanish-specific tests pass
- Core functionality remains intact
- No regressions introduced
- Language parity maintained across RU/EN/ES

## Usage Examples

### Web Interface
Users can select Spanish from the language dropdown in the top right corner of the web interface.

### API Usage
```bash
# BMI calculation with Spanish language
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/bmi" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "weight_kg": 70,
    "height_m": 1.75,
    "age": 30,
    "gender": "hombre",
    "pregnant": "no",
    "athlete": "no",
    "waist_cm": 80,
    "lang": "es"
  }'
```

The implementation maintains consistency with the existing Russian and English support while providing a natural user experience for Spanish-speaking users.
